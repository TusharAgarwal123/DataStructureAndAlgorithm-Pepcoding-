 * There are n construction sites in a town. We want to supply water for all the construction sites by
 *  building wells and laying pipes.

For each site i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i-1], or pipe in water from
 another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between
sites are given by the 2d array cost, where each row of cost contains 3 numbers ai,bi and wi where wi is the
 cost to connect ai to bi. connections are bidirectional.

Return the minimum total cost to supply water to all the construction sites.
